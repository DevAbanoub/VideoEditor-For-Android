# VideoEditor-For-Android
An Android video editor that includes video recording, cropping, adding bgm, whitening, adding filters, watermarking, and more.

Based on android hard-coded video editor, it does not support the following 4.3 systems, completes video capture through android api, completes processing of video data frames through OpenGL, and hard-codes the collected video stream through android hard encoder MeidaCodec. Use OpenGL to complete the whitening of the video, add filters, and add watermarks. Separation of audio and video and some mixing of audio using MediaCodec

Note: This project belongs to a semi-finished product. There is no commercial value for direct use. I also saw a lot of people's issues, but because the author has recently changed jobs, so there are more things, after the stability, will fill the remaining video through OpenGl stitching, and add bgm to the video, etc., will also solve those Issues.
